Cedar-Solve is a fork of `esa/tetra3 <https://github.com/esa/tetra3>`_. Please
refer to that repo for all documentation.

The focus of the Cedar-Solve fork is to make significant improvements to the
Tetra3 system while maintaining compatibility. We expect the improvements made
here to be merged back into the parent esa/tetra3 repository.

See `Issues <https://github.com/smroid/cedar-solve/issues>`_ for discussion of
the problems being addressed in this Cedar-Solve fork.
