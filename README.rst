Cedar-Solve is a fork of `esa/tetra3 <https://github.com/esa/tetra3>`_. Please
refer to that repo for all documentation.

The focus of the Cedar-Solve fork is to make significant improvements to the
Tetra3 system while maintaining compatibility.

See `migrating <migrating.rst>`_ for
information on updating programs that use Tetra3 to use Cedar-Solve instead.
